"HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE
QUEEN'S BENCH DIVISION","Either WAW has evidence of breach or it does not. It is not for the 5 Ds to present WAW with evidence of breach at this stage, 
although it is readily accepted that should WAW succeed at the speedy trial in establishing that the restrictive covenants are 
enforceable then Ds would be bound to disclose evidence as to the same.",https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/qb/2016/2319,
COURT OF APPEAL (CIVIL DIVISION),"And the truth of the matter is that whatever doubts one might have about the complainants individually, the body of evidence, 
from a score of separate people, all goes one way. Further, none of it seems to bear any mark of unreliability, and all of it accords with 
what one would generally expect of the CIO.",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2006/401.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"And so our simple submission is that this is in a sense a 'plums and duff' type of case, in which the Jury would be unable to reconcile 
the two versions of events. But that even -- putting it in other words other than those of Mr Justice Turner, I might perhaps describe it 
as a case in which the evidence is so at odds within itself that a properly directed Jury could not properly convict upon it.",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2260.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"Could I just ask you about one thing, Mr Spencer .... that was raised by Mr Swift in the course of his argument to me?
 It was not directly concerned I think with the position as it is being put now, but what he was for saying was that the Crown 
would not seek a conviction unless",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2260.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,There was a kick,https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2260.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"Unless there was a kick, yes. Is that the Crown's position?",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2260.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"It is not the position, I am afraid. No.",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2260.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,But I just thought that I would like to establish myself whether or not that was the Crown's position as Mr Swift seemed to be assuming,https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2260.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"It is not, your Honour, no. You will recall when I opened the case that I placed emphasis on the fact of the kick as being evidence of 
the specific intent",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2260.html, 
CRIMINAL COURT,and that is all that I am prepared to say.,https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2260.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"Where, however, the witness has been shown to be unreliable, [the judge] may consider it necessary to urge caution. In a more extreme 
case, if the witness is shown to have lied, to have made previous false complaints, or to bear the defendant some grudge, a stronger 
warning may be thought appropriate and the judge may suggest it would be wise to look for some supporting material for acting on the 
impugned witness's evidence.",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2274.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"There does not have to be independent supporting evidence in these sort of cases where sexual allegation are made. By their very nature 
it is unlikely, very often, that there is independent supporting evidence, but where possible in cases of this sort you ought to look for 
supporting evidence and it is not essential but you ought to look for it whenever you can and pay attention to it and compare it with the 
evidence of the girls, the two girls who are central to this case.",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2274.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,.. to decide the strength and the terms of the warning ...,https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2274.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"My Lord, so far as the respondents are concerned, we would seek a retrial. We would invite the Court to consider the very serious nature of 
the allegations, aggravated by the considerable breach of trust in the relationship between the appellant and his stepdaughter, S. We also 
invite the Court, if the complainant's account was a true one, to take into consideration the persistent nature of the offending - happening, 
on her account, sometimes twice a week for a substantial period of time.",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2274.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,We will now hear counsel on the issue of retria,https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2274.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"heir view, however, knowing her as they do, is that she would, when approached in the sensitive way they propose, understand what has
 happened and would be willing to give evidence again 
The same sort of problems do not attach to the second complainant, D. Although she herself has also not been asked, 
the police anticipate no problems on that score.

My Lords, the respondents therefore submit that this is, in the interests of justice, a case which ought to be retried. 
The evidence of particularly S was in accordance with her statement; and the jury, in that trial, accepted her evidence on oath.",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2274.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,Thank you,https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2274.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"I imagine that if the complainant S is unavailable, there probably will not be a retrial. It would not necessarily follow if the other 
complainant was unavailable.",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2274.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"The more important complainant, my Lords, is S",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2274.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"Yes, that is what I understand",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2274.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,That would be the important witness.,https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2274.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"My Lord, if it is only to be a retrial on S, the way that this matter came out initially -- it began as a result of a discussion of what was 
described as a ""sleep over"", where a game was played of something called ""dare"" or ""dare truth"", where the young girls in question were 
inviting each other to tell a story or to tell something that happened to them that was of a serious nature; and that is how these matters 
initially arose. It was very much a part of the appellant's case at the trial that these matters arose out of that and as a result of 
contamination and fabrication by the complainants in this case. In my submission, if only one is to be giving evidence, then prejudice 
may accrue.",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2274.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"That surely is something you can deal with at the trial. If this Court orders a retrial and, say, one of them dies and they offer no evidence;
 if one girl says, 'I am just not going to say it all over again', they offer no evidence: they have to. I do not see that there is any real difficulty 
as to this.",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2274.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"My Lord, in my submission the appellant would be precluded from having the argument before this Court as to whether or not there should 
be a retrial.",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2274.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"If you are saying that there is a basic unfairness, there is nothing to stop you taking that point, is there, before whatever judge is 
required to try the case?",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2274.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"My Lord, the Criminal Appeal Act provides that this Court has power to decide whether or not there should be a retrial on the basis of 
whether there is unfairness or prejudice to the defendant. There are a number of authorities on the area. Because I did not know until now 
what the Crown's position was - it may have been that they would have said this morning that they were not going to ask for a retrial. 
With respect to my learned friend, if one of the complainants says, 'No, we are not going to give evidence,' then that would be an end of the 
matter. If she then says that she is going to give evidence",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1999/2274.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"My Lord, the position is that, whilst your Lordships' Court is familiar with these authorities, I have to confess that I am not as familiar as I could,

CRIMINAL COURT,"I am not satisfied so that I am sure that all 20 identified meetings ... resulted in heroin being obtained by Peters. Some, a small minority of 
those meetings, are likely to have been cash-related. All of them concern this conspiracy. A reasonable conclusion would be that at least 
half of them concern the collection of heroin. This much is likely to be conceded in due course by the defence.",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2020/459.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"It is difficult to quantify how much heroin was supplied by Dewsbury (ie the West Yorkshire group) on each occasion ... It would, however, 
be unreasonable to conclude that two kilograms was obtained on every occasion although inevitably some. But I am satisfied, 
so that I am sure, that the amounts being ferried and dealt with were multiple kilos.",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2020/459.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"You supplied country wide multiple kilos of three different class A drugs. It is agreed that that is a mistake, it should read two different class 
A drugs, those being heroin and crack cocaine. It is true, not multi ton but multi kilos, and way in excess of Category 1 by some distance.",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2020/459.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,"I am not going to guess and I am not going to double count, but the figures on that iPad list relate to both class A drugs and cash linked to 
the sale of class A drugs. The phrase 'eye-watering' was used. I agree.",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2020/459.html,

CRIMINAL COURT,"You will be disqualified for one year and six months, but I am obliged to extend that pursuant to section 35 of the Road Traffic Offenders 
Act by half the term of your custodial sentence, which would amount to eight years and six months. But I take off the two years that you 
have spent on remand, so the extension is of six years and six months which means you will be disqualified from driving for eight years and 
you will be obliged to take an extended retest before you drive again.",https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2020/459.html,
CRIMINAL COURT,My Lord is absolutely right. I am more than glad that I am not asked to address the Court on that point.,https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2020/459.html,

ADMINISTRATIVE COURT,"I regret that I do not agree with the approach taken in Dobrowolski. The final step in the reasoning in that case is that this court should 
assess for itself the likelihood that the application of article 77 of the Polish Penal Code would result in the requested person’s release on 
licence, and then attach weight to that assessment when deciding whether extradition would be a proportionate interference with article 
8 rights. This step in the reasoning is a wrong turn.",https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2025/23,

with the intention of emigrating and having made all the necessary plans to do so, he may lose one habitual residence immediately and 
acquire a new one very quickly. If a person leaves his home country for a temporary purpose or in ambiguous circumstances, he may not 
lose his habitual residence there for some time, if at all, and correspondingly he will not acquire a new habitual residence until then and 
later. Of course there are many permutations in between, where a person may lose one habitual residence without gaining another",https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/t2/2025/22,

ADMINISTRATIVE COURT","Just [dealing] very briefly with the case itself, and the conviction itself, this was a conviction which revolved around what I'll call, 
in general terms, benefit fraud.
It was the use by Ms Ojebode of false names, false applications and very long applications for benefit, as I say under false names, 
which meant that she was being paid very [significant] amounts that she wasn't due either because she was claiming them in the 
wrong name [or] because she was working or both.
